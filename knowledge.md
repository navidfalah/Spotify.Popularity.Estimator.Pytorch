### MelSpectrogram:

This class is a method for converting audio waveforms into Mel Spectrograms. Mel Spectrograms are a way of representing audio signals in the frequency domain, but with a frequency scale (the Mel scale) that is designed to mimic the human ear's response more closely than the linear or logarithmic frequency scales. This makes Mel Spectrograms particularly useful for tasks involving human speech and hearing, such as speech recognition, music analysis, and audio classification.

#### Parameters of MelSpectrogram:

sample_rate (SAMPLE_RATE): This parameter specifies the sample rate of the audio signal, in Hertz (Hz). The sample rate is the number of samples of audio carried per second. It's important to match this with the actual sample rate of the audio to be processed to ensure accurate frequency representation.

n_fft (1024): This parameter specifies the number of points used in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). FFT is used to convert time-domain audio data into the frequency domain. A higher number of points provides a higher frequency resolution but requires more computational resources.

hop_length (512): This parameter defines the number of audio samples between successive frames in the spectrogram. A smaller hop length results in a higher temporal resolution of the spectrogram (more frames per second), but increases the amount of data and computation required.

n_mels (64): This parameter specifies the number of Mel filter banks (and thus Mel frequency bands) to use in converting the frequency domain signal into the Mel scale. Increasing the number of Mel bands can capture more detailed frequency information, but also increases computational complexity.
